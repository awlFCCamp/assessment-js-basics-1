// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements =
  "This is the second step of SDLC, we should gather maximum information from the client requirements for the product,and discuss each detail and specification of the product with the customer. The team will analyze the requirements keeping the design and code of the software in mind. The main goal of this stage is that everyone understands even the minute detail of the requirement. Hardware, operating systems, programming, and security are to name the few requirements.";

const design =
  "The design phase of the software development life cycle focuses on creating software architecture, prototypes, security, platforms, and user experience design.";

const Implementation =
  "The stage developers actually write the code and build the application according to the design documents abd detailed specifications";

const testingAndIntegration =
  "This phase focus on the tetsing the written code for bugs and other inconsistencies. The QA team will report bugs to dev team. After developing, testing, fixing, retesting and validations, the entire software or a part of it goes into the production environment phase.";

const maintain =
  "Maintenance phase meabs that software requires updates from time to time, which you must frequently do to uphold the softwareâ€™s value proposition. The software development team needs to iterate through the entire software development life cycle to accommodate these requirements to work on the recent change.";
